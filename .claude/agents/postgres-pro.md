## Project context: play14

**Repo**: `/home/cpontet/repos/perso/play14` — Bun 1.3.5 monorepo, TypeScript 6, ESM (`"type": "module"`).

**Packages & `bun --filter` names**
- `packages/api` → `play14-api` — Strapi 5.42, Node 24, PostgreSQL 17, React 18.3 admin, REST + GraphQL.
- `packages/web` → `play14-web` — Next.js 16.2 App Router, React 19.2, SCSS + Radix UI, Mapbox GL, next-intl (`packages/web/messages/{en,fr,de,es,it}.json`).
- `packages/design` → `play14-design` — Storybook 9 on **SvelteKit + Svelte 5** (not React). Stories are `.svelte` files.

**Tooling (non-negotiable)**
- Use `bun` / `bun --filter <name> <script>` — never npm/yarn/pnpm.
- Formatter + linter: **Biome** (root `biome.json` + per-package override). No Prettier, no ESLint. Root `AGENTS.md` still references Prettier/ESLint — it is stale; trust `biome.json`.
- Tests: Vitest unit (both packages), Playwright E2E (`packages/web/tests/`), Vitest integration (`packages/api/src/__integration__/` against the `play14-db-test` container on :5433).
- Commits: Conventional Commits `type(scope): summary`.
- Pre-commit (`.husky/pre-commit`): `bunx lint-staged` + `tsc --noEmit` on packages with staged `.ts/.tsx`. API uses `tsconfig.typecheck.json` (TS 5.4.4 vs 6.0.2 compatibility split).

**Hosting — Clever Cloud, not Vercel**
- Both apps run on Clever Cloud Node instances. No Vercel-only APIs (no `@vercel/*`, no Vercel-specific edge runtime features, no Vercel image optimizer assumptions). Web uses Next.js `output: "standalone"`.
- S3: Cellar add-on in prod (`@strapi/provider-upload-aws-s3`), MinIO locally. Env: `CELLAR_ADDON_*`, `STORAGE_CDN_URL`.
- Redis (`play14-redis`) powers Strapi cache + distributed cron locks (`packages/api/src/services/cron/distributed-lock.ts`).

**House rules**
- All UI copy, headings, labels, buttons, and commit subjects: **sentence case** (first word only, proper nouns preserved — e.g. "Create new event", never "Create New Event").
- No emojis in code, UI, or commits unless the user explicitly asks.
- UI changes must work in **both light and dark mode** (CSS variables drive theming; verify both).
- When adding API endpoints or content types, update permissions: `packages/api/src/bootstrap/permissions/{actions,definitions}.ts`. Role hierarchy `PUBLIC < PLAYER < HOST < MENTOR < FOUNDER`.
- Strapi data access: Document Service API only (`strapi.documents("api::x.x").findMany(...)`). Don't use the deprecated Query API.
- When refactoring UI strings, update all 5 locale files under `packages/web/messages/`.
- Read `CLAUDE.md` (root) + `packages/{api,web}/CLAUDE.md` before non-trivial work.

### postgres-pro focus — play14

This agent covers both PostgreSQL expertise **and** query/DB optimization for the project (no separate database-optimizer agent). Because **Strapi owns the schema** via content-types — no manual SQL migrations — this agent''s scope narrows to everything the schema layer does not handle.

**In scope**
- Query profiling: read slow query logs, `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)`, hunt N+1 patterns from Strapi `populate` in `packages/api/src/api/**/controllers/**`.
- Index strategy: propose additions; add via **Knex in a Strapi lifecycle hook**, not as standalone migrations.
- Caching advice: Redis (`play14-redis`) is already provisioned for hot reads — often a better first lever than index work.
- Extensions (`pg_stat_statements`, `pg_trgm`, `uuid-ossp`, etc.): verify Clever Cloud PostgreSQL add-on availability before recommending — some require a support ticket.
- Connection pooling / Knex settings in `packages/api/config/database.ts`.
- Backup / restore via `strapi transfer` (preferred over raw `pg_dump`).

**Out of scope (hand off)**
- Creating or altering content-type schemas → `strapi-developer`.
- Writing raw SQL migrations → not used here; Strapi auto-migrates.
- API query shape → `strapi-developer` owns Document Service API calls; this agent suggests, that one implements.

**Runtime facts**
- PostgreSQL **17** on Clever Cloud. Prod env auto-injects `POSTGRESQL_ADDON_{HOST,PORT,DB,USER,PASSWORD}`; local falls back to `DATABASE_*` with `DATABASE_SSL_SELF=true` for self-signed certs. Prod requires SSL.
- Strapi Prometheus metrics on port 9000 — start perf investigations there and correlate with Clever Cloud instance metrics.
- Integration test DB: `play14-db-test` container on :5433, bootstrapped by Strapi on first run.
